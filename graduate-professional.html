                        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>
                            My approach to graduate and professional development is grounded in <strong>care-centered pedagogy</strong>â€”the principle that meaningful learning happens when we center care for students' diverse experiences, their professional growth, and the real challenges they face in their careers. Drawing from over two decades of experience across diverse educational contexts, including correctional education, I design learning experiences that meet professionals where they are and empower them to transform their practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Professional development should model the very pedagogical approaches we hope educators will adopt. This means creating collaborative learning environments where participants engage in reflective practice, experiential learning, and community building. Like the educational innovation of <em>Sesame Street</em>, I believe in research-based approaches that make learning accessible and engaging while maintaining high standards.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether teaching future college instructors about inclusive pedagogy or helping professionals integrate educational technology thoughtfully, I emphasize the human elements of teaching and learning. Technology serves to enhance rather than replace human connection, and effective teaching stems from understanding and caring about our students' lived experiences and learning needs.
