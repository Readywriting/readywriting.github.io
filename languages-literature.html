                        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                        <p>
                            My approach to literature and language instruction is grounded in <strong>care-centered pedagogy</strong> and comparative cultural studies methodologies. I believe that literature serves as a crucial lens for understanding diverse perspectives, historical contexts, and the complexities of human experience across cultures and languages. Each text becomes a bridge for students to connect their own experiences with those of others, fostering empathy and critical understanding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Drawing from my experience teaching French language, Francophone Quebec culture, and Canadian comparative literature, I emphasize meeting students where they are in their linguistic and cultural journey. Language learning is deeply personal and often challenging—I provide supportive scaffolding while maintaining high expectations, understanding that students come with varying backgrounds and learning needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In both language and literature courses, I emphasize the interconnectedness of language, culture, and identity, encouraging students to develop not only linguistic competence but also cultural awareness and critical thinking skills. Like <em>Sesame Street</em>'s approach to inclusive representation, I believe in thoughtful material selection that ensures all students see themselves reflected while also encountering perspectives that broaden their worldview.
